// FILE: bag6demo.cxx
// Demonstration program for 6th version of bag

// Similar demonstration program as for earlier versions of the bag class
//  but explicitly exercises the bst_remove

#include <iostream>     // Provides cout and cin
#include <cstdlib>      // Provides EXIT_SUCCESS
#include "bag6.h"       // Provides the bag<Item> template class

// PROTOTYPES for functions used by this demonstration program:
void get_ages(bag<int>& ages);
// Postcondition: The user has been prompted to type in the ages of family
// members. These ages have been read and placed in the ages bag, stopping
// when the user types a negative number.

void count_ages(bag<int>& ages);
// Postcondition: The user has been prompted to type in an age
// The function tells the user whether that age has been entered
// The function stops prompting when a negative age is entered

void remove_ages(bag<int>& ages);
// Postcondition: The user has been prompted to type in an age
// The function tells the user whether that age has been removed
// The function stops prompting when a negative age is entered
